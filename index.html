                    <p>To Big Bear<p>
                    
                    <p>The season is starting to change, trees are blooming it rains now its cold and hot again, yet i miss you more everyday. I miss you so dearly, my own memory betrays me it has fallen for you , it loves you and asks about you daily.</p>
                    
                    <p>Its funny i have written multiple versions of this to find a way to just say i miss you. I find myself saying your name every now and then to put more of you into these gloomy days. When i look around i see all those things you left your mark on my life, from the meals i cook, to the lilies i water on my table, the soccer ball under my bed, the music all seems to be about you gosh choral music plays and your name dances in my brain, with the keychain i find myself rubbing the bear on days when i miss you most. For missing you comes in waves, and God some days i find myself drowning. I find your notes in my wallet every now and then in my wallet but still too afraid to read them again, i think i can only handle so much of missing you. I miss kissing you, how could i not it felt like stars exploding every single time we kissed like you could take my very breath away from me the longer we kissed, God knows i would have let you take it all if i didn't get light headed so easily. I remember how i would think and "she consumes me" every single time we kissed, i drown into your being.</p>
                    
                    <p>My world has since stopped spinning ever since the day you had to leave, oh jay-e shoma khalist, your place is empty my dear, i miss you with my very soul for you are gone but still everywhere, i carry pieces of you in every place i visit. These very days have made me aware that no soul has ever stood so close to my soul like you do and i realise i might never see your face, hear your voice, hold your hand, hear about how your day is going, listen to your troubles, hear you laugh or tell a joke and i begin to hate the very essence of what life is.</p>
                    
                    <p>And maybe sometimes you ask yourself what did you do for me to feel this way, and i guess that is the divine comedy of it all, you did nothing you simply existed and i found myself falling for the very being that weaves who you are. For once in my life, i whispered to God and said this is it, it shall be all i ever need in this life. And these feelings maybe shall exist to the end of my days perhaps i shall miss you and desire for us to be for what is a lifetime, and now i have written too much and at this point i have to stop writing i cannot burden you no longer with the state and existence of my feelings, i fear sometimes i reach a point even when i am too much for people to bear. A part of me hopes things between us don't just end up being about time or luck, the last time we talked you sounded so hopeless, like what's the point in hoping at all ?, but maybe it is not taboo to hope for better days because amai ehe ikozvino hazvisikuita asi hana ndeyenyu and parimwe zuva kana makukwanisa henyu and muchirikuda, mukada kufunga kuti muitore huyaimuchimanya inenge yakakusuwa hana iyi.</p>
                    
                    <p>and so ends my last letter to you</p>
                    
                    <p class="closing">Regards<br><span class="signature">Marcioso</span></p>
                    
                    <p>i guess this letter makes me uncivil, and for such behaviour i am truly sorry i guess i only dare do it once and break your rules this one time</p>
                    
                    <p> ( my choir performed last night at the SDASM concert, we sang well i wish you had been there to hear us sing, you would have been proud, and the SDASM choir sang so beautiful i wish you could have heard them, they sang in ways you would have loved ) </p>
                    
                    <p> ( and if you ever get the time watch Rocky 1 - 4 i think you would love those movies, i don't think i want to end this letter but i think i have to ) </p>

                    <p> ( my hands missed holding your face the other day so i found myself drawing, i preface because i didn't want to weird you out i realise i might easily make you feel uncomfortable, its the next link if you want to see it ) </p>

                    <p> ( a part of me debated sending this letter a part of me felt i should have and the other not, i guess we know what won, but in it all i pray i dont drive you away 
                        because of how strongly i feel about you and the ways i find expressing myself gosh it feels so jarring like how could i feel so strongly about you
                        but yet to me it feels so natural and so right. I had started writing a poem if you can even call it that but it all
                        started to feel so much like i would scare you away for good like it would be too much, but i guess i did mean it when i used to tell you,
                        you consume me, with desire, passion and  love i guess i have always wanted to feel that way about someone and that is how i feel for you.
                        You make all my rationality go out the window, i kneeled once and kissed your tummy i cant think straight when i am with you and 
                        i think thats all i have ever wanted to be consumed by someone and you consume me Nobuhle, you consume me  whole ) </p>
